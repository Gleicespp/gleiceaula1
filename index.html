          When I was 13 years old, I started working as a clothes embroiderer to
          earn some income for basic needs, and since then I have never stopped
          working. But I always really enjoyed studying, so I did my work
          outside study hours. On Saturdays and Sundays I attended church,
          because God is very important to me, so I had almost no free time, and
          it was like that for years.
